Th process includes: 
- exploratory data analysis
- feature selection, 
- model selection and performance metrics comparision,
- cross-validation 
- use permutation to test the new parameter's improtance in the selected model
- train the selected model with permutation features   
- Visulize the forecasted data with test data
- finalize the model features and evaluation
