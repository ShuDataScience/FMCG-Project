# FMCG Project - The raw data is dummy data minics a chocolate manufacturer. 
Section 1 includes: 
- find out the cheapest supplier for each ingredient 
- calculate the total cost of each supplier based on demand 
- calculate the total tax of each supplier based on demand 
- identify the cheapest supplier per recipe 
- identify the total cost (inc. tax) to meet all demand per quarter with the fastest suppliers

Section 2 is to build a forecast ML model to predict the demand more accurately. 
The key process includes: 
- exploratory data analysis
- feature selection
- model selection and performance metrics comparision
- cross-validation 
- use permutation to test the new parameter's improtance in the selected model
- train the selected model with permutation features   
- visualize the forecasted demand and compare with the test data
- finalize the model features and evaluation
